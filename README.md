# e_commerce

A new Flutter project.

It is a simple ecommerce app where you can favourite and remove items, add items to cart where it would display the total price of all the items.
There is an additional add item tab where you can create your own item which will then be displayed on your items tab and also perform the favourites and add to cart operations on it.
